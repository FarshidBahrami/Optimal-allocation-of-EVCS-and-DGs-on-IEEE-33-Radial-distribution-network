# Optimal-allocation-of-EVCS-and-DGs-on-IEEE-33-Radial-distribution-network

With 5 EVCSs and 3 DGs in play, we're focused on striking the perfect balance between network efficiency and sustainability. IPSO helps us navigate challenges such as adhering to a total DG power cap of 2200 kW and establishing safe operating limits for each generator (ranging from 50 kW to 2000 kW).

Summary of the Project: 
Load flow analysis method : Backward Forward Sweep
Simulation Software: MATLAB
Optimization Method: IPSO (Improved Particle Swarm Optimization)
Goal: Reducing the power loss and voltage deviation
Research Feild: EVCS and DGs, Renewable Energy
Result: 
1) 76% Improvement in Power loss Reduction after placing the DG and Size allocation
2) 84% Voltage Profile Improvement
